              Hi there! Welcome to my blog! ðŸ‘‹
            </h2>
            <p>
              I&apos;m a full-stack engineer building software to help local
              restaurants manage their online presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy exploring different areas of software engineering.
              I&apos;ve jumped from low-level cryptography to blockchain code to
              building scalable developer infrastructure. Below you&apos;ll find
              a list of projects I&apos;ve worked on recently.

            In the past, I&apos;ve really enjoyed working on a variety of
            different parts of the stack. Although for some it can make sense to
            specialize, I&apos;m more of a tinkerer and enjoy playing around
            with new technologies.
